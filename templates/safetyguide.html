<p>
We have been through lockdowns and most of us have been panicked by COVID  but as time passed people have clearly started to neglect the compulsory guidelines and have declined to take precautions whose effected is visible clearly as the numbers are rising once again after august and people have dropped the idea of social distancing and wearing masks but ignoring the fact that no possible cure or vaccination has been developed yet keeping that in mind we would like to suggest that people must follow the government guidelines. <br> <br>
The precautions one must take to not get infected is you must stay at home and if you need to go somewhere you must wear a face mask and preferably wear N95 or a fabric mask with removable filter as they are the most effective against the virus and always carry a alcohol based sanitizer with you that whenever you have physical contact with any object or person you should always sanitize your hands afterwards and always maintain distance from people. Moreover whenever you come home after visiting somewhere you must disinfect your clothes and should also sanitize yourself. Whatever you bought with yourself from outside you should also sanitize it and let it rest for sometime before you get it into your house. Also if you live with your grandparents or plan on to visiting them you should think twice as their immunity isn’t strong enough as you so probably not meeting them would be a good option. As its December already and people tend to fet cold and eventually their immunities hit a low point we must increase our intake of vitamin C and should also avoid cold beverages of any kind so that our body could fight back virus which tries to enter our body so that there are less chances of us getting cold or COVID. <br> <br>
The reason that everyone has started to neglected the precautionary measures and are thinking that our lives are back to normal is because Pfizer and BioNTech have said that they have vaccines which have pretty impressive effectiveness but still are in testing phase and even if the vaccine are made available it would take at least another year to be made available to general public as the first recipients to the drug would be front line workers so everyone must take precautionary measures seriously.

<h4>What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19?</h4>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better</li>
<li>Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people.</li>
<li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off.</li>
<li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
<li>Wear a fabric mask unless you’re in a particular risk group. This is especially important when you can’t stay physically distanced, particularly in crowded and poorly ventilated indoor settings.</li>
<li>
Wear a medical/surgical mask if you:
<ul>
<li>Are over 60,</li>
<li>Have underlying medical conditions,</li>
<li>Are feeling unwell, and/or</li>
<li>Are looking after an ill family member. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
