          <h3>Our Prespective</h3>
          <h6 class="section-subtitle text-muted">Everyone‘s in a state of fear and concern because of the current situation we don’t know if the person someone met a couple of minutes ago, was infected with coronavirus? or whether he carried those pathogens with his breath? Or the physical contact you made with someone was it safe? No ‘one can answer those questions but we can be take care of ourselves so in addition to the preventions and precautions one take we would like to add something to that in terms of a prediction and assistance system which will guide the prospective user by running an algorithm and comparing his body temperature and other symptoms with that of someone infected  with Covid and if the results of the diagnosis came out to be positive then guide the user to what precautions he should take and alert the nearby hospitals and medical workers about a potent patient and route him to nearest pharmaceutical dispensaries.</h6>
